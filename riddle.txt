The Riddle of the Sphinx

What walks on four legs in the morning,
two legs at noon,
and three legs in the evening?

This ancient riddle from Greek mythology was posed by the Sphinx to travelers.
Those who could not answer were devoured, while those who solved it could pass safely.

The answer represents the stages of human life:
- Morning (infancy): crawling on hands and knees
- Noon (adulthood): walking upright on two legs  
- Evening (old age): walking with a cane (third leg)

Can you think of other riddles that follow a similar pattern of describing different stages or states?
